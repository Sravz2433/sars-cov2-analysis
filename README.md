## Project Components

### 1. **Genome Assembly and Annotation**
- **Objective:** Assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome and annotate the resulting contigs.  
- **Approach:** 
  - Compare assembled contigs against a database of known genomes.
  - Identify and label putative genes in the genome.  
- **Tools Used:** Galaxy, Python, Biopython.

### 2. **Variant Classification and Phylogenetic Analysis**
- **Objective:** Identify and classify SARS-CoV-2 variants to understand their evolutionary relationships.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Utilize evolutionary tree construction techniques.  
  - Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to study variations in sequences.  
- **Tools Used:** MEGA, Clustal Omega, Python, Matplotlib.

### 3. **Structural Prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein**
- **Objective:** Predict and analyze the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Predict the protein structure from its amino acid sequence.  
  - Compare with known experimental structures.  
  - Analyze structural differences with SARS-CoV spike proteins.  
- **Tools Used:** Swiss-Model, ProDy, NumPy, Matplotlib, MultiSeq, VMD, NAMD.
